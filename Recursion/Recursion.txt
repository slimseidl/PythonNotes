Recursion

- A function may call other functions, including calling itself
- Very basic recursion function example:

        def count_down(count):
            if count == 0:            
                print('Go!')                  
            else:                        
                print(count)             
                count_down(count-1)        --> Calls itself inside the function 
            
    count_down(2)

    - function is repeated until count = 0
    - the function calls itself inside the function
