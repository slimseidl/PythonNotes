Joins

    - Multi-table reports are written with join statements
    - A join is a SELECT statement that combines data from two tables
        - Left / Right Tables 
    - The columns must have comparable data types
    - Usually, a join compares a foreign key of one table to the primary key of another

    - Dont necessarily need a join for simple queries

        SELECT Language, Population
        FROM Country, City
        WHERE 
        Country.code = City.code
        ;
    

Prefixes and aliases

    - Occasionally, join tables contain columns with the same name
    -  names must be distinguished with a prefix. The prefix is the table name followed by a period
        - orderhed.custname 
    - Aliases 
        - prefixes make table / col names too long, use an alias with AS 
        - Select department.name as Team, employee.name as emp 
        - uses the AS keyword to create an alias 

Join Types 

    - INNER JOIN, which selects only matching left and right table rows.
    - FULL JOIN, which selects all left and right table rows, regardless of match.
    - The join clause appears between a FROM clause and an ON clause

    - The FROM clause specifies the left table
    - The INNER JOIN or FULL JOIN clause specifies the right table
    - The ON clause specifies the join columns

            SELECT Department.Name AS Group,
        Employee.Name AS Supervisor
        FROM Department
        Inner join Employee
        ON Manager = ID;

    - Left and Right Joins 
        - LEFT JOIN selects all left table rows, but only matching right table rows.
        - RIGHT JOIN selects all right table rows, but only matching left table rows.

    - Equijoins 
        - compares columns of two tables with the = operator
        - Most joins are equijoins
        - A non-equijoin compares columns with an operator other than =, such as <, >, ≤, and ≥
        - So you can use a join where a column is > another column or other logical operands 
        - non equijoin example 

            Buyer Table 
            Name	MaxPrice
            Lisa Ellison	600000
            Sam Snead	900000
            Jiho Chen	500000
            Maria Rodriguez	800000

            Property Table 
            Address	Price
            23 Maple Street	700000
            4 Oak Street	850000
            59 Alvarado Avenue	1299000
            800 Richards Road	1000000

            SELECT Name, Address
            FROM Buyer
            LEFT JOIN Property
            ON Price < MaxPrice;

            Result 
            Name	Address
            Lisa Ellison	NULL
            Sam Snead	23 Maple Street
            Sam Snead	4 Oak Street
            Jiho Chen	NULL
            Maria Rodriguez	23 Maple Street

            ** non-equijoin selects all buyers along with properties priced below the buyer's maximum price.
