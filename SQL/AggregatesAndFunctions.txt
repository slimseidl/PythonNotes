Simple Functions 

    - A simple function operates on an expression enclosed in parentheses, called an argument, and returns a value
    - Some functions have several arguments, separated by commas, and a few have no arguments
    - Each simple function operates on, and evaluates to, specific data types 
    
    Example Functions 

        - Operate between columns on tables 

        - ABS(n)
        - LOG(n)
        - POW(x, y)
            - Select POW(2, 3) = 8
        - RAND()
            - random number between 0 and 1
            - Select RAND()
        - Round(n, d)
            - n rounded to d deciaml places 
        - SQRT(n)
            - square root of n 
            - Select SQRT(25) = 5 
        - Concat(s1, s2, s3, etc..)
            - SELECT CONCAT('Super ', Name)  FROM Avatar WHERE ID = 1;
            - Select Concat('Super ', CustName) From Customer Where CreditRating = 'A+'
                - Returns Super Followed by Customer's name where customer credit rating is an A+ 
        - Lower()
        - Upper()
        - Replace(s, from, to)
            - s with all occurrences of from replaced by to
            - SELECT REPLACE(Orange', 'O', 'St'); = STRANGE 
        - Substring(s,  starting position, len)
            - Substring of s that starts at position starting pos with length len
            - SELECT SUBSTRING ('Boomerang', 1, 4); = BOOM 
        - CURDATE()
            - Current date, time, or date and time in
            - Select curdate() 
        - Now()
            - same as cur date 
        - Day(date), month(date), year(date)
            - day month or year of a date
            - Select Month('2025-10-15') returns 10
        - Hour, minute, second (time)
            - returns an hour minute or second of a time given 
        - DateDiff(date1, date2)
            - number of days between dates 
        - TimeDiff (date1, date2)
            - amount of time between dates 
    
Aggregate Functions 

    - processes values from a set of rows and returns a summary value
    - Common Aggregates:

        - Count()
        - Min/Max()
            - SELECT MIN(Salary) From Employee 
        - Sum()
        - Avg()
        - Variance()
            - standard variance of selected values 

    - Group By Clause 

        - groups rows with identical values into a set of summary rows
        - Important:

            - One or more columns are listed after GROUP BY, separated by comma
            - GROUP BY clause returns one row for each group
            - Each group may be ordered with the ORDER BY clause
            - GROUP BY clause must appear before the ORDER BY clause and after the WHERE clause (if present)

    - HAVING Clause 

        - Filters the group by clause instead of WHERE 
        - follows the GROUP BY clause and precedes the optional ORDER BY clause
        - must include the same aggregate function that appears in the SELECT
        - Ex: 

            SELECT CountryCode, SUM(Population)
            FROM City
            GROUP BY CountryCode
            HAVING SUM(Population) > 2300000;
