Data Pipelines 

    - A data pipeline is a series of data processing steps
    - Data pipelines contain three elements: the data source, the data processing, and the data destination.
    - The data source is the data's original location
    - data processing, a query requests the desired features and instances for the analysis
    -  data destination is a place where the data scientist can access and interact with the data.

SQL to Pandas Translation 

    - pandas contains a method, DataFrame.query(), which allows users to write SQL-like queries
    - DataFrame.query("Feature == 0") will return all instances in the dataset for which Feature is exactly equal to 0
    - Can use and, or, not 
        - &, | = OR, ~ = not
    - In pandas, the dataframe is called first instead of the features. Adding .query defines the query
        - DataFrame being the table name
        - Where statement is passed to the .query method in parentheses
        - Select clause passed to brackets
            - OrderHed.query("OrderDate == '2025-01-01')['CustName', 'CustID']
