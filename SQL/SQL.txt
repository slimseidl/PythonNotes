Relational Databases 

    - Many tasks in data science involve extracting and manipulating data from a database
    - Structure 

        - Table, Row, Column, Cell 
        - One value per cell. A cell cannot contain multiple values.
        - No duplicate column names
        - No duplicate rows
        - No row order. The organization of rows on storage media, such as a disk drive, never affects query results.

NULLs

    - The result of NOT NULL is NULL.
    - TRUE AND NULL evaluates to NULL. TRUE OR NULL evaluates to TRUE.


Keys 

    - A unique column never contains duplicate values in different row
    - Every table has a primary key 
        - a column, or group of columns, that identifies individual rows
        - must be unique and not NULL
    - A foreign key is a column, or group of columns, that refer to a primary key
        - must either be NULL or match some value of the referenced primary key
        - prevents references to non-existent rows
    -  data types of the foreign and primary keys must be the same, but the names may be different
    - foreign key is usually in a different table than the referenced primary key, but may be in the same table
    -  primary key is marked by a solid circle (●)
    - foreign key is marked by an empty circle (○) and an arrow leading to the referenced primary key

SQL 

    - A keyword is a reserved word with special meaning.
        - most database systems, keywords and identifiers are not case-sensitive (select vs SELECT)
    - A literal is a fixed numeric or text value
    - An identifier is a user-defined name for a table, column, database, etc 
    - A clause groups a keyword with identifiers and expressions
    - A statement is a complete database action

Simple Queries 

    - Operators 

        - An operator is a symbol that computes a value from one or more other values, called operands
            - Arithmetic operators compute numeric values from numeric operands
            - Comparison operators compute logical values TRUE or FALSE
            - Logical operators compute logical values from logical operands
            - unary operator has one operand
                - NOT is unary
            - binary operator has two operands
                - most operators are binary 
            - Arithmetic and comparison operators return NULL when either operand is NULL

Expressions 

    - An expression is a string of operators, operands, and parentheses that evaluates to a single value
    - Operator precednece in expressions:

        - unary (-)
        - ^
        - * / %
        - + - 
        - = != < >
        - NOT 
        - AND 
        - OR 

SELECT Statements 

    - has a SELECT clause and a FROM clause
    - Select * = ALL 
    - Can use operators in select statemnets 
        - Select balance + payment from orderhead
        - SELECT 2 * (Balance - Payment)
    
WHERE clause 

    - Filter 

IN Operator 

    - WHERE Language IN ('Dutch', 'Kongo', 'Albanian');

LIKE Operator 

    - use % to match any number of chars 
        - like 'L%t' matches lot, lift, loot, or even "lol cat"
        - like '20-%'
    - use _ to match exactly one char 
        - like L_t matches lit and lot but not loot 

Distinct Clause 

    - used with a SELECT statement to return only unique values
        - Select Distinct from where 
    
Order By Clause 

    - sort order 
    - select from where order by 
    - use DESC for descending order 
        - order by field desc 
    
Limiting Clauses

    - limit the number of rows returned by a query
    - MySQL supports a LIMIT clause
        - Select From Limit 20; = top 20 rows 
    - SQL Server supports a TOP clause
        - Select Top 20 * From 
    - Oracle uses FETCH 
        - Select From Fetch FIRST 20 Rows Only;
    - used without an ORDER BY clause, the rows that appear are unpredictable
        - usually used with an ORDER BY clause
