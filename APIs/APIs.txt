API's 

    - An API is a mechanism that allows communication between software applications
    - if __name__ == '__main__'
        -  if we run the code from the script that it is in, then we can execute what lives within the if statement

    - API running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ if we maintain the persistence of the script APIs.py 
        - if we want to programmatically get the data from our own API, we need to use the requests package and access the data
        - interactively access the API running on our own machine using the following code:

            import requests 
            data = request.get('http://127.0.0.1:5000/')
            type(data)
