        - all developers working on the project can install the required packages
        - can recreate the same development environment on different machines
        - CI/CD system can automatically install the required packages and run tests
        - allows for better collaboration and project tracking within versioning 
    
    - Creating Requirements.txt files

            - generate a list of installed packages and their versions
            - run pip freeze > requirements.txt to redirect the output to a file named requirements.txt
                - Puts all current requirements into requirements.txt file 
            
        - Work within a virtual environemnt 
            - Install with python -m venv .venv

            - pip install -r requirements.txt for req's file 

        - Generate requirements.txt 
            - pip freeze > requirements.txt
