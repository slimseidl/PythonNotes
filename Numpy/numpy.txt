Numpy 
- provides tools for scientific and mathematical computations
- includes functions that can be used to perform common linear algebra operations, fast fourier transforms, and statistics
- uses an array data type that is conceptually similar to a list, consisting of an ordered set of elements of the same type
    - created using the array() constructor from the numpy package
        import numpy as np
        my_array1 = np.array([15.5, 25.11, 19.0])

- numpy provides functions that create empty pre-sized arrays
    Zero Function 

    - zeros() function creates an array with a 0 for every element, and ones() uses 1 for every element
    - argument to zeros() and ones() is an integer (length) for a 1-dimensional array

Linspace Function 

- creates a sequence by segmenting a given range with a specified number of points
-  linspace(0, 1, 11) creates a sequence with 11 elements between 0 and 1 inclusive: 0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9, 1.0.
    -   np.linspace(0.25,1.0,4) = [ 0.25 0.5 0.75 1.0 ]


- Mathematical operations between arrays are performed between the matching elements of each array. 
- For example, [5 5 5] + [1 2 3] would compute [5+1 5+2 5+3], or [6 7 8].
