Functions
- def add(x,y)
    - return x + y
    - val = x + y
    - return val 

def subtract(a,b):
    x = a - b 
    return x 


Function Stubs
    functions whose definitions havent been written yet 
    behavior can be captured before diving into function details
    def calories(num_steps):
        pass 
        - nothing is performed until function is defined

    def steps_to_cals(steps):
        print(f'FIXME: NEEDS DEFINED')
            - adds a note that it needs defined when used

Functions can include branches / loops 

Fees given an item selling price for an auction webssite

Functions = objects in python 

Variable scope 
    when a variable is created inside a function, it is only visibile in the function 
        def add(x,y):
            sum = x + y 
            return sum 

            sum is a local variable inside the function add() 
    Global variables are defined outside of functions and available to the whole file 


Namespaces
    maps names to objects
    used to keep track of objects in a program 

    globals()
        can print to view global variables 
        functions are global unless built in 
    locals()
        local variables
