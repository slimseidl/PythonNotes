Debugging 

    -  problem's cause is called a bug, and troubleshooting is called debugging.
    - A basic debugging process is visual inspection
    - a wise programmer only writes a few statements at a time, and then runs those statements to ensure the statements work correctly

    - Inserting debug output statements

        - output helps determine whether the preceding statement has the bug
        - Ex: Put "\nDEBUG: tempValue is: " to output
        - Put "\nDEBUG: fahrenheitValue is: " to output

    - Hierarchical debugging

        - A programmer may divide the statements into regions, and insert one debug output statement after each region
        - f a region's output is bad (doesn't match expected output), the programmer can then create sub-hypotheses for the statements


Example debug statements

                        float a
                        float b
                        float c
                        float aSquared
                        float bSquared
                        float cSquared

                        a = Get next input
                        b = Get next input
                        Put "DEBUG: a is " to output
                        Put a to output
                        Put " and b is " to output
                        Put b to output

                        aSquared = a * 2
                        bSquared = b * 2
                        Put "\nDEBUG: aSquared is " to output
                        Put aSquared to output
                        Put " and bSquared is " to output
                        Put bSquared to output

                        cSquared = aSquared + bSquared
                        Put "\nDEBUG: cSquared is " to output
                        Put cSquared to output

                        c = SquareRoot(cSquared)
                        Put "\nc is: " to output
