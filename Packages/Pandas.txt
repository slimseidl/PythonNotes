Pandas 

    - a Python package that stores and manipulates datasets
    - represents datasets with the DataFrame type
    - A dataframe consists of rows and columns, which represent dataset instances and features
    - The set of row labels is called the index and the set of column labels is called columns
    - Usually, row labels are automatically generated integers

DataFrame vs Arrays 

    - While NumPy package supports array objects, dataframe is similar to an array because:

        - Both are indexed, ordered, and mutable containers
        - Both represent data in multiple dimensions, called axes
        - Both have a shape, a tuple of integers representing the number of elements along each axis

    - DataFrames Differ in Several Ways from Arrays 

        - Dataframes are always two-dimensional. Arrays may have zero, one, or many dimensions
        - Different dataframe columns may have different types. All array values have the same type
        - Dataframe labels may be integers, strings, or other types. Array indexes are integers only

    - Subsetting Data 

        - involves choosing specific rows and columns from a dataframe according to labels, indices, and slices
        - A single column can be selected by using the label of the desired column
            - country['Population'] or country.Population

        - Multiple columns can also be selected by using an array of strings
            - country[['Name', 'Population']]

        - The iloc(x,y) method for a dataframe is used to select an individual element using an index location, where x is the row and y is the column
            - country.iloc[0,1] returns the element in row 0 and column 1

        - The colon character : is used in slice notation to select multiple rows or columns
            - country.iloc[:5,1:3] returns rows before row 5 and columns 1 thru 2.

        - The loc(x,y) method can also be used to subset data, but y, in this case, is an array of column labels
            - country.loc[:6,['Continent','Population']]
                - Rows 0 - 5 and columns specified returned 

    - Subsetting with Comparison and Logical Operators 

        - == True if two are equal 
        - & = and 
        - | = or 
        - ~ = not 

        Examples:

            - country[country['Continent'] == 'Europe'] # where continet = europe 
            - Population >= 1 million 
                - country[country['Population'] >=  1000000]
            - Continent is asia and greater than 250mil pop 
                - country[(country['Continent'] == 'Asia') & (country['Population'] > 250000000)]

    - More DataFrame Methods 

        - drop()
            - Removes rows (axis=0) or columns (axis=1) from dataframe. labels specifies the labels of rows or columns to drop.
        - drop_duplicates()
            - Removes duplicate rows from dataframe
            - subset specifies the labels of columns used to identify duplicates
            - If subset=None, all columns are used.
            - takes an additional inplace parameter to modify in place or not
            - Ex: country.drop_duplicates(subset='Continent')
        - dropna()
            - Removes rows (axis=0) or columns (axis=1) containing missing values from dataframe
        - insert()
        - replace()
        - sort_values()
