Loops
- While 
- For 
    - for i in range(0,10)
        - iterates from 0 to 9
    - for i in range(0,10,2)
        iterates from 0 to 9 going up by 2 
Break and continue
- Break breaks the loop and goes to the end 
- Continue continues to the next loop iteration 
    
Enumerate
- can help access a list index and value in one go
    - list = [4,8,10]
    - for index in range(len(list)):
        value = list[index] 
        print(f'Element {index}: {value})
    OR 
    - for (index, value) in enumerate(list):
    print(index, value)
    - iterates over list and gives index and associated value
