Cleaning Data 

    Dirty Data 

        - missing, outlier, and duplicate data
        - Missing data is an unknown or inapplicable value
            - NULL  - databases 
            - NAN  - python
            - NAT - Not a Time 
            -    NONE - unspecified
        - Outlier data is a numeric value that is much larger or smaller than other values
            - Two - Three standard devs from the feature mean 
        - Duplicate data are two or more identical instances in a dataset


    Discarding Data 

        - Dirty data may be removed from a dataset by discarding
        -  Dirty instances are usually discarded when:
            - dirty instances comprise a small percentage of the dataset.
            - dirty instances are random
            - Instances are duplicates.
        - Discarding features removes dirty features that contain a high percentage of missing values, such as 60% or more
        - Pairwise discarding retains dirty instances for some analyses and discards dirty instances for others
        - Instances are discarded only when an analysis uses a dirty feature

    Imputing Data 

        - replaces missing and outlier data with new values to retain all features 
        - Hot-deck and cold-deck imputation replace missing and outlier data with a value from a randomly selected instance
        - Mean imputation replaces missing and outlier data with the mean value of the feature
            -  Missing and outlier data are excluded from the computation of the mean
        - Regression imputation replaces missing and outlier data with a value computed from a regression model
            - EX for miles per gallon: mpg = 40 - 2 * Cylinders - Liters.

    Python Cleaning 

        - df.drop()
            - removes rows or colums (axis=0 for rows, 1 for cols)
            df.labels specifies what to drop 
        - df.drop_duplicates()
            - df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
            - lifestyleClean = lifestyle.drop_duplicates(subset=['annual_hours_worked'])
        - df.dropna()
        - df.duplicated()
            - Returns a Boolean series that identifies duplicate rows in df. true indicates a duplicate row
        - df.fillna()
            - replaces NA / NAN with a value 
            - df.fillna(value=20, inplace=True)
        - df.isnull()
            - 
        - df.mean()
            - returns the mean of rows or columns 
            - skipna=True skips the na's 
        - df.replace()
