Manipulating data

    - The first step of the data wrangling process is data discovery, or exploring patterns and trends within a dataset
    - Data manipulation is the process of organizing or subsetting a dataset to explore a research problem
    - used to split datasets into multiple groups based on a categorical feature

Grouping 

    - used to separate a dataframe into subsets based on levels of a categorical feature
    - A frequency table is a table containing group sizes for a categorical feature

Pivot Tables 

    - calculates and displays descriptive statistics after grouping based on values of two categorical features
    - One categorical feature is assigned to the pivot table's rows, and another categorical feature is assigned to the columns
    - A contingency table is a special case of a pivot table in which the descriptive statistic is the number of instances in each combination of categorical features

Data manipulation in Python

    -  pandas package contains two methods for data manipulation
    - df.groupby() splits a dataframe df into subsets
    - df.pivot_table() creates pivot tables based on two categorical features

    - df.groupby() sets the grouping feature using the "by" parameter
        - Missing values for the grouping feature can be removed by setting dropna=True or grouped into a separate category by setting dropna=False
        - cars.groupby(by=["Drive"]).median()
    - df.pivot_table() takes several parameters
        - "value" specifies the values in the pivot table's elements
        - "index" specifies the row features 
        - "columns" specifies the column groupings 
        - "aggfunc" specifies the aggregate type for the values 
        - cars.pivot_table(values="MPG",index="Drive",columns="EngineType",aggfunc=np.median)
