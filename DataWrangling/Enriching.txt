Enriching Data 

    Appending Data for Enrichment 

        - Datasets can be enriched by appending new instances or features from external datasets
        
        - To append instances or features, prepare a subset of external data as follows:
            - Identify the external dataset of interest.
            - Identify a matching feature in the external and original datasets. The matching feature must uniquely identify instances of both datasets.
            - Usually, only a subset of the external dataset is of interest. Extract the subset, including the matching feature.
            - Structure and clean the subset, as described elsewhere in this material.





The hmeq_small dataset contains information on 5960 home equity loans, including 7 features on the characteristics of the loan.

Load the data set hmeq_small.csv as a data frame.
Create a new data frame with all the rows with missing data deleted.
Create a second data frame with all missing data filled in with the mean value of the column.
Find the means of the columns for both new data frames.
