Data wrangling

    - the process of preparing source data for efficient and accurate analysis
    - include removing missing values, formatting features uniformly, and appending related data from external sources
    - sometimes called data munging or data preparation

Six Steps of Data Wrangling 

    1. Discovering
        -  data exploration
        - Familiarizes the data scientist with source data

    2. Structuing Data 
        - transforms features to uniform formats, units, and scales

    3. Cleaning 
        -  removes or replaces missing and outlier data
    
    4. Enriching 
        - derives new features from existing features and appends new data from external sources
    
    5. Validating 
        - verifies that the dataset is internally consistent and accurate
    
    6. Publishing Data 
        - makes the dataset available to other data scientists by storing data in a database, uploading data to the cloud, or distributing data files

ETL - Extract, Transform, Load 

    - A process that extracts data from transactional databases, transforms the data, and loads the data into an analytic database
    - transforms data in a staging area, such as a temporary database, prior to loading data to the analytic database
    - Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) is a variant of ETL that loads raw data directly to the analytic database and transforms the data in place
    - Similar to wrangling
    - Wrangling is more informal than ETL, executed manually 
    - ETL is a more automated process that uses pipelines to modify data 
    - ETL tools are also known as data integration tools 
        - extract and merge data from many different database systems
