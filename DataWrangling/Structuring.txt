Structuring data

    - Formatting data

        - All data within a single column and similar data in multiple columns should be stored in a uniform format
        - All dates and times might be stored as the datetime data type, with a 24-hour clock in Coordinated Universal Time
        - All lengths might be stored as meters.
            - facilitates aggregating and comparing data within and across columns
    
    - Feature Scaling 

        -  numeric features in a dataset often have different scales
        - Feature scaling converts numeric features to uniform ranges
        - Common Methods:

            - Standardization converts features to a range centered at 0, with 1 representing a standard deviation

                XStandardized = (Xoriginal - meanX) / standardDevX

                - standardized value is a z-score 
                - most between -2 and 2
            
            - Normalization converts features to the range [0,1]

                Xnormalized = (Xoriginal - minX) / (maxX - minX)

                - Standardization is usually preferred over normalization, since standardization positions values relative to the mean and standard deviation

    - Unpacking Data 

        - Some features encode multiple types of data as a single value
            - PartCode feature may include characters that describe the part color
        - An overloaded feature encodes multiple types of data
        - A simple feature contains only one type of data
        - data encoded in an overloaded feature should be extracted and stored as new, simple features
            - overloaded feature usually remains in the dataset as reference information
